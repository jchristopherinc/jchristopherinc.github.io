Hello ðŸ˜€

I'm Christopher. I'm a self taught programmer. I work as a Product Developer in a SaaS firm in [Chennai, India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai). I was born and brought up in [Sivakasi, India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sivakasi). 
I'm write software programs for a living, predominantly in Java/JavaScript. I sometimes write programs in [Elixir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elixir_(programming_language)) for fun. 

I started this blog to get back to writing after a long time. Sometimes you find my blogs interesting and sometimes boring.
